### How I use R

I am using a MacBook Pro running OS 10.9.5, with a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7.
The memory chip is an 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3.
Graphics managed by NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB.

I like to use R in its native environment, meaning I don't use RStudio very much.
I like the native environment because I can get quicker access to more open R script
windows. This allows me to take code from one to another quicker and allows me to
keep my R learning script and comments right at hand. I will discuss other key
reasons for using R in its native environmentlater.

Coursera's video files are good but not sufficient for my learning style and 
processes. I need more examples that I can run and explore in interactive sessions.

I have learned over the years as a Stata user/programmer to work directly from a
script file. When using video or books to learn from, I copy examples into a script
file and run the code from the script file. This is very easy to do in my Mac
environment, simply by highlighting the code I want to run and pressing Cmd-enter.
I don't know about the Windows environment, but I would guess something similar is
possible. This environment makes it very simple to quickly cover a lot of material
in a great interactive learning environment.

I have made a couple of attempts to learn R since 2010 but I found the learning
curve to be too steep and I could get done what needed to be done much faster
using Stata, especially the 80 to 90 percent of Data Science work --
Data Management or data munging as some call it today.

However, this year, in May 2014, I discovered Hadley Wickham's work. I stumbled
into a reference about "Tidy Data." I also discovered a book by Jared P. Lander,
"R for Everyone: Advanced Analytics and Graphics." Jared's presentation in his
book made it much easier to break into R. Both gave me additional incentive 
to learn R, I have been collecting a few books about R since May 2010. So I have
used them also in this new round of learning R.

Additional incentive came from work. In order to reduce the risk for International 
Paperbox if something happened to me, I determined that I needed to create 
a data analysis and reporting environment based around R because it is more 
likely that someone could learn the R system, if properly documented. I believed 
that this could be done with less effort than learning the same system 
based around Stata.

Since starting a serious leg of this journey around the first of September 2014, 
I have discovered that I made a good decision. It is much easier to set up a 
data analysis and reporting system that others can manage in R than it would be 
with the same system in Stata. I am convinced. I intend to help you understand 
what I mean by demonstrating and discussing the advantages I have found.

One final motivation is to support the world wide effort of learning provided by
massive online open courses like Coursera, edX and others. R is free and
thus anyone with access to a computer can study and try what I share 
and hopefully we can learn from and be edified by this process of sharing
and helping each other.
